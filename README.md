# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This Python script implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using numpy for board management.

### Functions:

1. **Show_xo(m)**
   - Displays the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
   - Parameters:
     - `m`: numpy array representing the game board.
   - Returns a formatted string showing the board with 'x', 'o', or ' ' (empty) positions.

2. **who_won(m)**
   - Determines if there is a winner in the game.
   - Parameters:
     - `m`: numpy array representing the game board.
   - Returns 'x' if player 'x' wins, 'o' if player 'o' wins, or None if no winner yet.

3. **next_move(m, player)**
   - Handles the next move for a given player ('x' or 'o').
   - Parameters:
     - `m`: numpy array representing the game board.
     - `player`: current player ('x' or 'o').
   - Takes input for the player's move and validates it.
   - Updates the game board if the move is valid.

### Usage:

The script initializes a 3x3 numpy array for the Tic-Tac-Toe board and allows players 'x' and 'o' to make alternating moves until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Include functions Show_xo, who_won, next_move here

m = np.array([[" ", " ", " "],
              [" ", " ", " "],
              [" ", " ", " "]])
move = 0

while who_won(m) == None and move < 9:
    next_move(m, "x")
    move += 1
    print(Show_xo(m))
    if who_won(m) == 'x' or who_won(m) == "o":
        print(f"{who_won(m)} won! Congratulations!")
        break

    if move == 9:
        print("Draw! Play again to see who is the best")
        break

    next_move(m, "o")
    print(Show_xo(m))
    move += 1
    if who_won(m) == 'x' or who_won(m) == "o":
        print(f"{who_won(m)} won! Congratulations!")
        break
```
